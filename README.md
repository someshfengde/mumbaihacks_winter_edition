## Introduction

Fashion GAN is a machine learning-based system that generates fashion images and recommends products based on the fashion style illustrated in the images. This backend code is responsible for handling the image generation, product recommendation, and serving the API endpoints.

## Usage

Once the server is running, you can access the API endpoints to generate fashion images and get product recommendations. Here are some example API endpoints:

- `GET /`: health check for the API 
- `POST /process_image`: Recommends products based on a given fashion image.

Make sure to check the API documentation for more details on the available endpoints and request/response formats.
